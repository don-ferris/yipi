# yipi
Full-featured, fully integrated media server in a pre-built Docker container, with easi-peasi fully guided setup/configuration

The goal of Yipi is to allow a user to launch a prebuilt Docker image, on an x86/64 (NUC, thin client, Mac Mini, or any old laptop or) PC or a RasPi (or other ARM-based SBC - maybe even certain Android TV boxes that are rootable?). Available at ripi.local (localhost/local_ip:9471), the initial boot screen  guides the user through a complete setup which prompts for all necessary choices/options/input to install Plex, Emby, or Jellyfin, a VPN, a bittorrent client, torrent/usenet downloaders (Radarr, Sonarr, Lidarr, etc.), and a host of other media-related self-hosted services including Audiobookshelf, Lazy Librarian, PhotoPrism, and anything else that's applicable.

Yipi will offer full integration with Ripi (automated media ripper), and Stash - a disk array solution, both of which will offer the same type of guided setup.
