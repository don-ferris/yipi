# yipi
Yipi - the all-in-one, full-featured media server in a pre-built Docker container - with easi-peasi fully guided setup/configuration

The goal of Yipi is to allow a user to launch a prebuilt Docker image, on an x86 (NUC, thin client, Mac Mini, or any old laptop or) PC or a RasPi (or other ARM-based) SBC (maybe even certain Android TV boxes that are rootable?), go to localhost/local_ip:9471 (or yipi.local), and be greeted by a guided setup which will prompt for all necessary choices/options/input to install Plex, Emby, or Jellyfin, a VPN, a bittorrent client, torrent/usenet downloaders (Radarr, Sonarr, Lidarr, etc.), and a host of other media-related self-hosted services including Audiobookshelf, Lazy Librarian, PhotoPrism, and anything else I can think of.

Yipi will offer full integration with Ripi (automated media ripper), and Stash - a disk array solution, both of which will offer the same type of guided setup.
